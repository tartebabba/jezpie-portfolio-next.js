# Back to it!

After an unexpectedly busy couple of months post-bootcamp, I'm excited to return to regular building and programming. I've missed it a lot. The break was  eventful, offering a nice change from the intense months leading up to June.

## What have I been doing?

What a journey these past two months have been! I took a well-deserved holiday and learned how to unwind properly, enjoying some peace without being busy all the time. Soon after, my fiancé graduated, marking the end of our five years in Manchester. We then moved back to Yorkshire, which took much longer than I expected. Gone are the days of one-day moves from university; now it’s a week-long job on either side. We're finally settled and back to a normal rhythm. I've also been soaking in the late summer, recharging, and spending quality time with my family now that we’re closer in distance.

## What's Next?

My break allowed me to reflect on my work and future directions. I realised how much I missed back-end development. Prior to my break, I was heavily focused on front-end development, but now I'm ready to plunge back into back-end projects.

Additionally, I want to learn Python, especially for back-end development and scripting. It's a skill I've wanted to develop for some time, and I'm curious to see how much I can transfer from what I've learnt programming in JavaScript. Python and JavaScript will be my foundation for the time being, as I don't want to fall into the trap of learning too many languages and not getting good at any single one.

I'm also working towards stabilising my portfolio. This will enable me to concentrate more on skill development. Furthermore, I'm eager to get back to programming and creating. I'll hopefully pick writing back up too.
