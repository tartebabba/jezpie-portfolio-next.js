# A Quick Introduction

Hello! If you're reading this, it means I've successfully integrated a 'blog' component into my portfolio website, as I promised earlier this week. I'm celebrating this as a minor personal victory.

## Wonderful - But Why Does It Matter?

Writing has always been a personal challenge for me, as I've often felt insecure about my ability to write, especially clearly and quickly. "Face your fears," they say. I guess this is why I've decided to build this component into my website, so that I can overcome my insecurity with expressing my thoughts, experiences, and learnings publicly and improve my writing skills.

While the primary goal is to communicate my ideas and experiences clearly, I also want to evolve my ability to write and hopefully find my unique style in the process.

I don't know the direction I want to go just yet, but this is a good first step. I expect this to undergo a lot of changes and refinement as I learn and continue to develop, so I ask only for your patience.

## What's on the Horizon?

In terms of development, the main focus is still to continue building and tinkering, to improve my skills.

I'm trying to decide how to showcase what I'm specifically working on, as I think it's always interesting to see what people are working on. Whether it will be a simple to-do list is still undecided. Meanwhile, I'll continue to revamp Music Clash for the browser.

Additionally, I'll be exploring Python more and experimenting with some automation.

Let's keep this brief for now.

With love,

JP.
